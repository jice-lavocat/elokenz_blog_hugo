## How to join us ?

If you have never join a twitter chat before, do not worry, it&#8217;s** like a regular Twitter discussion** but with a **guest**, a **predefined topic**, some **moderators**, and many public attending it, and retweeting it. You will be interacting with a guest and following a semi guided discussion. One thing extra you need to know :** a twitter chat goes super extra fast**. So, if you want to enjoy it, it&#8217;s often better to use <a title="Twitter Chat - VCBuzz" href="http://twchat.com/hashtag/vcbuzz" target="_blank">Twchat</a> to mute some noise and echo.

## When to join ?

The chat will be held at 12PM EDT / 4PM GMT. So if you live in Paris (or a related time zone) you should be on Twitter at 6PM just before the end of office hours. If you live on the East coast of the US, you need to prepare a sandwich to enjoy during the chat which will be at noon.

## How to enjoy it ?

To better enjoy the event, we recommend you the following. First **save the date and book a free hour**. The chat activity is so intense that if you had an important task to perform during the same time, you will probably not be able to focus on both the chat and your task.

Second, don&#8217;t forget that the chat is public and that you can** interact with everyone** to **create connections** and find people with similar interests to you.<img style="display: none;" src="http://inbound.org/articles/vote?article_id=145969&value=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" />

Third, **if you want to organize a Twitter chat**, you can find a lot of tips from Ann Smarty&#8217;s guide : <a title="Hosting a Twitter Chat" href="http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-chat-guide/" target="_blank">5 Steps to Hosting Successful Twitter Chats</a> (if you read French, you can also check <a title="Graphemeride - Twitter Chat" href="http://www.graphemeride.com/blog/pourquoi-ne-pas-utiliser-twitter-chat" target="_blank">this post on Graphemeride</a>).

Finally, as a chat is always better when there is people to chat with, **we would love if you could share the news** about it. So you can either <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.elokenz.com/content-marketing/twitter-chat-jice_lavocat-vcbuzz-july-15&text=Join%20the%20%23VCBuzz%20Twitter%20Chat%20on%20July%2015%20with%20@elokenz_com%20%23content_marketing%20%23blogging%20%23engagement&via=jice_lavocat&related=elokenz_com" target="_blank">Tweet about it</a>, put a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://blog.elokenz.com/content-marketing/twitter-chat-jice_lavocat-vcbuzz-july-15" target="_blank">comment on Facebook</a> or a <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://blog.elokenz.com/content-marketing/twitter-chat-jice_lavocat-vcbuzz-july-15" target="_blank">post on Google+</a>.
