When this blog was initially started it was covering news for our previous platform &#8220;WordiZ&#8221;. The service was initially thought just to be an** author rank system**. We were aggregating your articles and judging on social signals we were able to discover the category of blogger you were belonging to : casual blogger, experienced blogger, professional web journalist&#8230; and so on.

However, we realized that we could do so much more than that. **Ranking people is nice, but there is always so many things you can do on top of that.** Hence, we decided to go for the more creative way, and to build a new set of tools for **bloggers, web journalists and community managers**.

Our team took some time in brainstorming sessions and we decided that the first goal we wanted to achieve was to** help online authors to engage with more readers**. Why would we do that ? Actually, with WordiZ we realized that the main difference between famous bloggers and the rest of the crowd was the** level of engagement**. Famous bloggers take time to answer the most insignificant comment on their blog and to follow discussions on social media.

As a consequence, the solution comes under the shape of an &#8220;**engagement management platform**&#8221; (does it sounds too geeky ?). We will progressively release tools to help you managing your readers, engage conversation and transform them into evangelist of your blog, journal or product.

So our application changes its name and becomes <a href="http://mandrillapp.com/track/click.php?u=30143833&id=d200d6d3617849b0875a79d828584ee6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elokenz.com&url_id=4559e54bc8cdea7bba40a33f6184f7b766904836" target="_blank">Elokenz</a>.

## Give a Try to Elokenz

We have worked hard during the past weeks to release the first tools and we are already pretty happy about the result. If you are **tagging your articles with the authorship markup**, you can already use our tool. Take a step in and be my guest, connect to our brand new dashboard :

<a title="Sign in Elokenz" href="http://www.elokenz.com/accounts/login/google-oauth2/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-224" src="http://blog.elokenz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/sign-in-button-1024x192.png" alt="Google+ signin" width="171" height="35" /></a>

The UX might not be optimal at the moment and few things might be missing to have a top star product, but if we manage to validate the product and get some initial customers, be sure that this will evolve pretty quickly.
