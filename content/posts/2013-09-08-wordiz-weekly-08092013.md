    Avoid any confusion now between Inbound Marketing and Content Marketing thanks to Frank who explains the differences between the two. Quote from his text :
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <div id="r1PostCPBlock">
      <strong>Inbound Marketing</strong> (as defined by HubSpot): “Instead of the old outbound marketing methods of buying ads, buying email lists, and praying for leads, inbound marketing focuses on creating quality content that pulls people toward your company and product, where they naturally want to be. By aligning the content you publish with your customer’s interests, you naturally attract inbound traffic that you can then convert, close, and delight over time.”
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <strong>Content Marketing</strong> (as defined by Content Marketing Institute): “Content marketing is a marketing technique of creating and distributing relevant and valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage a clearly defined and understood target audience – with the objective of driving profitable customer action.”
