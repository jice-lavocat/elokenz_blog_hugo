## Why Use Authorship?

<img class="size-full wp-image-16 alignleft" alt="Author signature" src="http://www.wordiz.it/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/author-signature-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" />For years bloggers and website owners have complained about people stealing their texts and duplicating their content. With the Search Engine Results Positions (SERP) race, many of them were even loosing at this game.

Nowadays, no perfect solution exists yet, but are closer than ever to reach one. By adding a &#8216;signature&#8217; on your texts, you can keep track of everything you ever wrote on the web. People at Google used the term &#8220;<a title="Authorship attribution" href="https://plus.google.com/authorship" target="_blank">authorship attribution</a>&#8221; to describe the simple fact of signing a content with your name.

By doing so, search engines and web tools like [WordiZ][1] can track your writings and associate your name with a global environment. It becomes easy to know that are a specialist in science or in children-care by collecting the blog posts your have written some months ago.

Therefore, if you want to make the most out of WordiZ, you need to have a signature on your blog posts to tell us that you were the actual writer of the text. We will collect many articles on our [Authorship category][2] to help you having the code correctly implemented on your website.
