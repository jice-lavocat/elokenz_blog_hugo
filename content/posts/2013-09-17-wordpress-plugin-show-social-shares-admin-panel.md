[WordiZ Admin Social Shares][2] is a **wordpress extenssion** that will allow you to see the number of shares of your article directly from the backend administration panel.  
<!--more-->

  
After the installation, the listing of your articles will show three new columns : one for Facebook **likes**, one for **retweets** and the last one for Google **+1**.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-80" alt="Admin with Admin Social Shares installed" src="http://blog.wordiz.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/screenshot-1.png" width="861" height="673" />][3]At the moment, one important feature is really missing : sorting articles by shares. Hopefully we will get some time soon to add the feature to the project. If you are a developer, you can also fork the project on github.
